Twitter Mention Responder
Overview

The Twitter Mention Responder script monitors mentions for a specific user and responds to them with a predefined tweet. It utilizes the Tweepy library for interacting with the Twitter API and includes error handling to log any issues encountered.
Features

    Monitors mentions for a specified user on Twitter.
    Responds to the first mention with a predefined tweet.
    Logs errors encountered during execution using Python's logging module.

Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

    Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
    Tweepy library installed (pip install tweepy).
    Twitter API credentials (bearer token, API key, API key secret, access token, and access token secret).

Usage

    Replace placeholders BEARER_TOKEN, API_KEY, API_KEY_SECRET, ACCESS_KEY, and ACCESS_SECRET with your actual Twitter API credentials in the script.

    Run the script:

    bash

    python twitter_mention_responder.py

    The script will continuously monitor mentions and respond to the first mention it finds with a predefined tweet.

Example

Here's a simplified example of how to use the script:

python

import time
import tweepy
import traceback
import logging

# Initialize Tweepy API client
api = tweepy.Client(bearer_token=BEARER_TOKEN, consumer_key=API_KEY, consumer_secret=API_KEY_SECRET, access_token=ACCESS_KEY, access_token_secret=ACCESS_SECRET)

# List to keep track of already mentioned tweets
alreadymentioned = []

# Monitor mentions continuously
while True:
    try:
        # Get mentions for a specific user
        mentions = api.get_users_mentions(id=1472630658652676103)
        
        # Process each mention
        for index, mention in enumerate(mentions.data):
            # Respond to the first mention only if it hasn't been responded to before
            if index == 0 and mention not in alreadymentioned:
                alreadymentioned.append(mention)
                print(mention)
                whoami = str(mention.id)
                
                # Create a tweet in reply to the mention
                api.create_tweet(in_reply_to_tweet_id=whoami, text="TEST")
                
    except Exception as e:
        # Log any errors encountered
        logging.error(traceback.format_exc())
    
    # Wait for 30 seconds before checking for new mentions
    time.sleep(30)
